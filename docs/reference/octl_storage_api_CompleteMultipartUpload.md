      --ChecksumCRC32C string                              This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
      --ChecksumCRC64NVME string                           This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
      --ChecksumSHA1 string                                This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
      --ChecksumSHA256 string                              This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
      --ChecksumType string                                This header specifies the checksum type of the object, which determines how part-level checksums are combined to create an object-level checksum for multipart objects.
