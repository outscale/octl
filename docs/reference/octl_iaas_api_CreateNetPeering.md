## octl iaas api CreateNetPeering

Requests a Net peering between a Net you own and a peer Net that belongs to you or another OUTSCALE account.

### Synopsis

Requests a Net peering between a Net you own and a peer Net that belongs to you or another OUTSCALE account.

This action creates a Net peering that remains in the `pending-acceptance` state until it is accepted by the owner of the peer Net. If the owner of the peer Net does not accept the request within 7 days, the state of the Net peering becomes `expired`. For more information, see [AcceptNetPeering](#acceptnetpeering).

**[IMPORTANT]**

* The two Nets must not have overlapping IP ranges. Otherwise, the Net peering is in the `failed` state.

* A peering connection between two Nets works both ways. If an A-to-B connection is already created and accepted, creating a B-to-A connection is not necessary and would be automatically rejected.

For more information, see [About Net Peerings](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-Net-Peerings.html).
